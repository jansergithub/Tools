-  __%matplotlib notebook__  
   The __%matplotlib inline__ function is used to render the static matplotlib plots within the Jupyter notebook. 
   Try replacing the inline part with notebook to get zoom-able & resize-able plots, easily. 
   Make sure the function is called before importing the matplotlib library.
   
-  __%latex__  
   The __%%latex__ function renders the cell contents as LaTeX. It is useful for writing mathematical  
   formulae and equations in a cell.  
   
-  __Making the Notes stand out__  
We can use alert/Note boxes in your Jupyter Notebooks to highlight something important or anything that needs to stand out. The colour of the note depends upon the type of alert that is specified. Just add any or all of the following codes in a cell that needs to be highlighted.   
   - __Blue Alert Box: info__  
     <div class="alert alert-block alert-info"
     <b>Tip:</b> Use blue boxes (alert-info) for tips and notes. 
     If it’s a note, you don’t have to include the word “Note”.
     </div
   -  __Yellow Alert Box: Warning__
      <div class="alert alert-block alert-warning"
      <b>Example:</b> Yellow Boxes are generally used to include additional examples or mathematical formulas.
      </div
