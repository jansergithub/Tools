-  __%matplotlib notebook__
   The __%matplotlib inline__ function is used to render the static matplotlib plots within the Jupyter notebook. 
   Try replacing the inline part with notebook to get zoom-able & resize-able plots, easily. 
   Make sure the function is called before importing the matplotlib library.
