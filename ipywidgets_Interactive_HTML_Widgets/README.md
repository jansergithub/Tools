With interactive widgets in a Notebook, you can use the full power of Python to express calculations and generate visualization — while exposing “knobs and dials” to an end user so they can control aspects of the visualization. In this sense, you can use Notebooks as lightweight “apps” for anyone.

ipywidgets are interactive HTML widgets for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel.

Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Users gain control of their data and can visualize changes in the data.

Learning becomes an immersive, plus fun, experience. Researchers can easily see how changing inputs to a model impact the results. We hope you will add ipywidgets to your notebooks, and we're here to help you get started.
